# 100 Days of Code Python Challenge


## Motivation
This would help me learn coding skills and integrate those acquired skills with Finance and Economics.
Look out for my upcoming app portraying these skills!


## Day 19 
Created a simple game using the turtle graphics in the #100 days of code challenge.
The game is a race between 7 turtles; you have to bet on the turtle that would win.


## Day 20
Created the basic functionality for a snake game. Not yet done with the whole game.
I would finish up tomorrow! Let's get it!


## Day 21
Finished the snake game.
I would try and add some customizations and cheats to make it more interesting!
